## Introduction to Integrations

The Fluent UI Web Component libraries, composed from [FAST Components](https://www.fast.design/), can be used on their own to build modern web sites and applications, but they are also designed to be used in combination with a wide variety of existing technologies. The integrations section of our documentation is dedicated to helping you get FAST Element working with your existing or preferred stack.

Not seeing an integration for your preferred technology? We'd be happy to work with you to add it. Feel free to kick off a discussion by [opening an issue on the FAST component GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/fast/issues).
