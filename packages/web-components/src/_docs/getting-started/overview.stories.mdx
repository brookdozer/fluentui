## Overview

## What are the Fluent UI Web Components?

Fluent UI Web Components is a collection of technologies built on Web Components and modern Web Standards, designed to help you efficiently tackle some of the most common challenges in website and application design and development.
`@fluentui/web-components` is a library of Web Components that composes `@microsoft/fast-foundation` and supports Microsoft's Fluent design language.

The Fluent UI web components from A-Z (from [Accordion](?path=/story/components-accordion--accordion) to [Tree View](?path=/story/components-tree-view--tree-view)) are in the COMPONENTS section of this side bar.

See the [installation page](?path=/story/getting-started-installation--page) for more details

### What are Web Components?

"Web Components" is an umbrella term that refers to a collection of web standards focused on enabling the creation of custom HTML elements. Some of the standards that are under the umbrella include the ability to define new HTML tags, plug into a standard component lifecycle, encapsulate HTML rendering and CSS, parameterize CSS, skin components, and more. Each of these platform features is defined by the W3C and has shipped in every major browser today.

### How does Fluent UI Web Components leverage Web Components?

Fluent UI Web Components is built directly on the W3C Web Component standards, and does not create its own component model. This allows our components to function the same as built-in, native HTML elements. You do not need a framework to use Fluent UI components but you can use them in combination with any framework or library of your choice. See [Integrations](?path=/story/integrations-introduction--page) for more.
